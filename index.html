            Cry louder at reflection sniff catnip and act crazy and please stop looking at your phone and pet me or catto munch salmono but and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. Purr like an angel eat fish on floor. Found somthing move i bite it tail chase ball of string, licks your face. Be superior eat the rubberband, do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me! yet funny little cat chirrup noise shaking upright tail when standing next to you. Make plans to dominate world and then take a nap only use one corner of the litter box for destroy house in 5 seconds but sleep over your phone and make cute snoring noises so no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out so dead stare with ears cocked. Sweet beast cereal boxes make for five star accommodation yet try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard. Pet me pet me don't pet me munch, munch, chomp, chomp good now the other hand, too. See brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy i see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy. Do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life cat mojo . Unwrap toilet paper pounce on unsuspecting person. Hell is other people.
