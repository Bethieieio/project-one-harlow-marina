### Colour Schemes
- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to help me choose the above colours of #FFF3B0 yellow and #3c54a3 blue.
They are colours that represent the sun and water respectively and both colours stand out and are easy to see as text when the other colour is its background partner. I also used black and white as black can be seen with the yellow background and white to give the site cleaniness and a llight airy feel (background).

### Typeography 
- [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is what used to pick the three types of font I have on the website.
- Cinzel used in headings and the nav bar. It is a bold stand out presence with its all caps look.
- Yellowtail is only used for the motto. I just really like it, very flowy that matches what the motto means    .
- Zilla Slab used in all other text. Very simple and easy to read. It matches the heading font perfectly.

## Page Content 
### Hero Image, Logo and Slogan
- A hero image is an oversized banner at the top of the website.
- The site has one of a photograph at the marina down one of the pontoons.
- It gives a sense of where the users boat will be if they choose to moor their boat at the marina.
- The image has a white opacity of 0.5 to make the logo and slogan readable inside the image.

- The logo is the marinas name "Harlow Marina" it is in the Cinzel font.
- It is in the normal blue font and has the normal yellow shadow, making it stand out to the text in the same font.
- It is located in large font in the middle of the hero image, making it the first words the users would read on the site.

- The slogan is located underneath the logo. 
- It is the only text in the YellowTail font and is a solid black colour.
- "Modern Mooring and Making Memories". The use of alliteration makes the company easy to remember and what they do.
