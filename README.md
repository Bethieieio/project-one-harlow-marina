## 1. User Experience 

### Target Audience 
This website is aimed for people in and around Harlow that are wanting to moor their craft in a safe and secure place, while giving them a sense of a community.

### Visitor Goals 
This site allows people to find out what to expect of the marina by showing what it has to offer.
Visitors are able to contact the different parts of the marina through the website. The site also shows where the marina is located.

### Business Goals
Business wise, the websites aim is to advertise to as many people as possible.
The more people that will see the site and see what services they offer, the more people will enquire about mooring there, purchase items at the chandlery or to use facilities like pump out and diesel purchases.

### User Stories
As somebody who owns a narrowboat, I want somewhere safe to moor my boat in an area close to my home.
I would need the cost of how much mooring would cost for my 57ft narrowboat for 4 months for the winter.
I also need somewhere I can shop for parts for my boat and to buy things needed like fuel and firewood before I go out on the river all under one roof.

#### Expectations
I would like to ask specific questions to the right people who know stock of parts they have in stock or whether they will need to order the parts in. I need to know how much the going rate is for a craft size I own in writing before I enquire about mooring here.
