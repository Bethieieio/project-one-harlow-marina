### Colour Schemes
- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to help me choose the above colours of #FFF3B0 yellow and #3c54a3 blue.
They are colours that represent the sun and water respectively and both colours stand out and are easy to see as text when the other colour is its background partner. I also used black and white as black can be seen with the yelloe background and white to give the site cleaniness and a llight airy feel.
