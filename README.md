### Colour Schemes
- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to help me choose the above colours of #FFF3B0 yellow and #3c54a3 blue.
They are colours that represent the sun and water respectively and both colours stand out and are easy to see as text when the other colour is its background partner. I also used black and white as black can be seen with the yellow background and white to give the site cleaniness and a llight airy feel (background).

### Typeography 
- [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is what used to pick the three types of font I have on the website.
- Cinzel used in headings and the nav bar. It is a bold stand out presence with its all caps look.
- Yellowtail is only used for the motto. I just really like it, very flowy that matches what the motto means    .
- Zilla Slab used in all other text. Very simple and easy to read. It matches the heading font perfectly.

### Features

### Hero Image, Logo and Slogan
![image](assets/images/print-screen-one.png)
A hero image is an oversized banner at the top of the website.
The site has one of a photograph at the marina down one of the pontoons.
It gives a sense of where the users boat will be if they choose to moor their boat at the marina.
The image has a white opacity of 0.5 to make the logo and slogan readable inside the image.



#### Navigation Bar
(Picture in above paragraph)
The Navigation bar takes the user to all the main sections to the website.
It has the blue background and the yellow text in the Cinzel font.
When the user hovers over one of its links, a yellow line appears underneath the word to show it is a link.
When the user is at the very top of the page, the nav bar is located just below the hero image.
When the user scrolls down the page or uses the links in the nav bar, it then sticks to the top of the page.
When the user scrolls back to the top, it goes backk to its original place.
